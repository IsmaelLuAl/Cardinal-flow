# Cardinal-flow
User manual for the data flow developed in R with the Cardinal analysis package and its respective user interface.

The following will explain how to download the programme and use it.


  1. To use the programme you need the R programming language: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/
  2. We will also need an integrated development environment for R called rStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
  3. Download the compressed file "FlowFiles" from the repository and unzip it in the folder where you want to save the files.
  4. When decompressing it, the files necessary for the application to work will appear and a folder "data" inside this folder is where the files with imzML and ibd extension should be included.
  5. Once we have all this ready, we open rStudio and at the top of the "Session" tab we select "Set Working Directory" and indicate the folder where we have unzipped the files.
  6. From here we can run the programme and use the user interface, to know how to use it correctly read the user manual carefully.
